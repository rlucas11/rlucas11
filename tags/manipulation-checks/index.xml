      <description>In my previous post I focused on the question of whether replicators need to work with original authors when conducting their replication studies. I argued that this rule is based on the problematic idea that original authors somehow own an effect and that their reputations will be harmed if that effect turns out to be fragile or to have been a false positive. In this post, I focus on a second rule, one for which my objections may seem more controversial, at least to those who already agree that replications are valuable.</description>
